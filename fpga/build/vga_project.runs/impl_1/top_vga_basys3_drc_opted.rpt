PREG Output pipelining  
DSP u_top_vga/u_draw_bg/rgb_nxt3 output u_top_vga/u_draw_bg/rgb_nxt3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

MREG Output pipelining  
DSP u_top_vga/u_draw_bg/rgb_nxt3 multiplier stage u_top_vga/u_draw_bg/rgb_nxt3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.
